# Hand Detection  

A real-time hand detection program using **Python, OpenCV, and YOLOv5**. The model was trained on Google Colab and detects hands in a webcam feed with high accuracy.  

## Features  
- Real-time hand detection using **YOLOv5**  
- Custom-trained model for improved accuracy  
- Processes live video feed using OpenCV  
- Efficient and optimized for real-time performance  

## Requirements  
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:  
```bash
pip install torch torchvision opencv-python numpy
```

You also need to clone the **YOLOv5** repository if you haven't already:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage  
Run the script to start real-time hand detection:  
```bash
python hand_detection.py
```
Make sure your trained YOLOv5 model is placed correctly in the project directory.  

## How It Works  
- Captures video from the webcam using **OpenCV**  
- Loads a custom **YOLOv5** model trained on hand images  
- Detects hands in real time and draws bounding boxes  
- Runs efficiently on CPU/GPU for smooth performance  

## Notes  
- Model was trained using **Google Colab** with a custom dataset  
- GPU acceleration is recommended for optimal performance  
- Adjust confidence thresholds as needed for different environments
